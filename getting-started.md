# Getting Started Guide

Nor is it beyond the sea. The fact is that the comments that have been made and the issues that have surfaced over the last few weeks reflect the complexities of race in this country that we've never really worked through - a part of our union that we have yet to perfect. That is true genius of this nation. I will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start-ups that will create the high-wage, high-tech jobs of tomorrow. But what the people heard instead - people of every creed and color, from every walk of life - is that in America, our destiny is inextricably linked.

Thank you very much everybody.
