I can't play. It's my dad. They're late. My experiment worked. They're all twenty-five minutes slow. Marty, this may seem a little foreward, but I was wondering if you would ask me to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance on Saturday. Well, they're your parents, you must know them. What are their common interests, what do they like to do together?

You know Marty, you look so familiar, do I know your mother?
